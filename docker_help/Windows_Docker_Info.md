# Docker setup for windows:

*** Please note that even if you are using docker via the command line/powershell, in order for the docker daemon to be running docker desktop has to be open.

## 1. Download docker desktop  
* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/  
* Click Windows and it should automatically start downloading

</p>

* Once it’s downloaded click on the file, and follow the install wizard 

## 2. Follow instructions for WSL (if prompted once docker installs)  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual

* Step 6: Install your Linux distro of choice -> shouldn’t be necessary unless you plan to use it outside the course

<p>&nbsp;</p>

*** If you are going to use the Auto Run script you may not even need this step
## 3. Install git  
* https://git-scm.com/download/win  
* Click 64-bit Git under the Standalone Installer header
