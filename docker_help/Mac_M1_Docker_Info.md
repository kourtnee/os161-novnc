</p>

* While that downloads open a terminal and enter (this step is in the previous link so if you’ve done it already you don’t have to do it again):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ```softwareupdate –install-rosetta```  
* Once docker is downloaded, double click the .dmg file in the downloads  
* Drag the docker application into the Applications folder  
* Open docker  
* Follow the setup wizard

*** If you are going to use the Auto Run script you may not even need this step  
## 2. Install git  
* Type git in terminal and allow the installation of command line editor tools
